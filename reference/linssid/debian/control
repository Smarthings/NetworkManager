Description: Graphical wireless scanner
 .
 LinSSID displays locally receivable 802.11 wireless attach points
 and ad hoc networks. A table is displayed with various parameters
 such as MAC address, channel, and signal strength. Graphs are also
 displayed with signal strength by channel and signal strength over time.
 This is very useful for finding channels with low interference for
 setting up a wireless router.
 .
 LinSSID is graphically and functionally similar to Inssider (for
 Microsoft Windows) and is written from scratch in c++ using Qt5,
 qwt, and the boost libraries.
