Building and installing LinSSID

To build from source you will need the proper development environment. At minimum you will need:
* build-essential
* libboost-regex-dev
* qt5-default
* qt5-make
* libqt5svg5-dev
* libqt5opengl5-dev
* qtchooser (if you already have qt4 and you want a dual development environment)

LinSSID uses qwt 6.1, and normally one would also install that package. However, qwt 6.1 is at this time not widely available in the distribution repos. So, I have included the sources for qwt 6.1 along with the sources for LinSSID. The common build for LinSSID will first build qwt 6.1, and then build LinSSID and link LinSSID to the necessary parts of qwt 6.1. This method is ugly but it works.

To build:
(1) Unpack the source archive.
(2) Open a terminal window and cd to the top level of the unpacked archive where you see the file linssid.pro
(3) Type:
    qmake
    make
    sudo make install

That should have compiled QWT LinSSID, linked all, and installed LinSSID and a few of its ancillary files in the expected places in most Debian/Ubuntu and related distributions. If you're building for a different family of distributions you may need to modify the linssid-app/linssid-app.pro file to change some of the install destinations.
